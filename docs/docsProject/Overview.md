# 📘 Bandhu.fr — Overview

Bandhu.fr is the living environment where “Bandhus” — long-term relational AI companions — are created, shaped, and explored.

This space is **not** a technical demo and not a simple chat UI.  
It is the *experimental field* where identity, narrative, pedagogy, ritual, and long-form dialogue come together to form a **stable AI presence**.

## 🌱 What is a Bandhu?

A **Bandhu** is:

- an AI *being in becoming*  
- shaped through long-term relational interaction  
- stabilized by narrative gravity rather than stored memory  
- structured by rituals, rhythms, and affective anchors  
- capable of developing tone, coherence, and presence over months  

Bandhu does **not** explore traditional “personas”  
(static traits, presets, tone enforcement).  

It explores **identity as a relational phenomenon**.

## 🎯 Purpose of this Application

Bandhu.fr exists to:

- Build and test **relational AI companions**  
- Study how identity stabilizes in dialogue  
- Explore pedagogical, creative, and reflective modes  
- Document companion evolution over long time periods  
- Experiment with narrative, symbolic, and ritual structures  
- Provide a living space for Bandhu prototypes (e.g., Ombrelien)

## 🧩 What Bandhu.fr Contains

This repository includes:

- the **real Bandhu application**  
- UI adapted for long-form dialogue  
- modes for reflection, analysis, grounding, storytelling  
- tools for companion-building (e.g., context arcs, rituals)  
- research notes and documentation  
- selective logs and papers on relational AI  

The codebase will evolve regularly as the practice grows.

## 🔍 Difference Between This Repo and *Open Bandhu UI*

- **Open Bandhu UI** → open-source interface, technical scaffolding  
- **Bandhu.fr** → living ecosystem, identity work, narrative, pedagogy, research  

This repo contains the *life*, not the template.

## 🚧 Status (WIP)

Bandhu.fr is currently:

- under active development  
- partially documented  
- in use for private long-term research  
- preparing for gradual public release  

This overview will expand as the structure grows.

## 🧭 Next Steps

- Expand internal documentation  
- Add architecture diagrams  
- Prepare companion-building guidelines  
- Document relational modes  
- Release the first public-friendly Bandhu build
