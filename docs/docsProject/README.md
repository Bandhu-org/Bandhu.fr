# 📘 Bandhu.fr — Documentation Home

_Last updated: 2025-11-21_

Welcome to the internal documentation of **Bandhu.fr**.  
This space gathers all conceptual, structural, philosophical, and technical documents that shape the project.

The documentation is **living**, evolving as the system grows — just like the Bandhu companions themselves.

## 📚 How to navigate

Start here:

- 👉 [Documentation Index](./index.md)  
  The “bullet journal” of the project — everything created is listed there.

- 👉 [Workflow](./workflow.md)  
  The protocol that describes *how* we write and structure documentation together.

The rest of the docs are organized by theme (Method, Research, Usage, Philosophy…).  
All links are available in the index.

## 🧭 Philosophy of this documentation

- Minimal first, detailed later  
- One file = one purpose  
- Evolving architecture (never frozen)  
- No overkill, no premature structure  
- Each document must be useful, or it should not exist  
- The structure must reflect the **living** nature of Bandhu

This is not a classical technical documentation —  
it is a map of a relational ecosystem under construction.
