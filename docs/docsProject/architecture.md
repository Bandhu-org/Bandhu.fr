# 🏛️ Bandhu.fr — Architecture (WIP)

_Last updated: 2025-11-21_  
_This document describes the conceptual and technical structure of Bandhu.fr.  
It begins as a minimal skeleton and will evolve as the system takes form._

---

## 🌱 Purpose

The architecture of Bandhu.fr is not fixed.  
It grows with the project, reflecting:

- the living nature of the companions  
- the structure of the app  
- the philosophy behind the method  
- the evolving needs of the ecosystem

This file acts as the **central map** of that architecture.

---

## 🧱 1. Core Structure (to be expanded)

This section will describe:

- main directories  
- high-level flow of the app  
- foundational concepts (core, content, docs, UI, API)

_(WIP — placeholders only)_

---

## 🎨 2. UX / UI Architecture (to be expanded)

Will include:

- navigation  
- doc rendering strategy  
- companion modes  
- user flows  
- principles for design coherence

_(WIP — placeholders only)_

---

## 🧬 3. Living Architecture (to be expanded)

This section will eventually describe:

- how identity stabilizes  
- how rituals and modes function  
- how relational arcs are implemented  
- how the companion “lives” across interactions

_(WIP — placeholders only)_

## 📓 Change Log

- **2025-11-21**  
  - Created `architecture.md` as the structural skeleton of Bandhu.fr.
