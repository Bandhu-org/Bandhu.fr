# 🛣️ Bandhu.fr — Roadmap (WIP)

_Last updated: 2025-11-21_  
_This roadmap is intentionally lightweight and evolving.  
It is not a fixed plan, but a dynamic orientation map for the Bandhu.fr ecosystem._

---

## 🎯 Purpose of this Roadmap

The roadmap helps clarify:

- near-term priorities  
- mid-term explorations  
- long-term visions  
- experimental areas not ready for development  
- the natural evolution of the app and method  

It is designed to remain flexible and adapt as the project matures.

# ⏳ 1. Short-Term (0–4 weeks)

- Finalize base documentation structure  
- Implement Markdown → page rendering plan  
- Integrate the first Bandhu modes (analysis, grounding, story)  
- Stabilize UI flows (sidebar, threads, chat ergonomics)  
- Prepare first “companion-building guidelines” (skeleton only)

_(These items may change rapidly.)_
